# Quest Starship Cabin

A small Unity/OpenXR relaxation cabin for Meta Quest, built for sideloaded immersive ambience.

The current prototype is a seated, comfort-first VR room with a forward starfield window, warm cabin lighting, simple procedural furnishings, and generated ambient audio. It is intended as an original optimistic sci-fi relaxation space, not a recreation of any copyrighted franchise.

## Current Status

Stable baseline: `Atmosphere V3`

- Native Quest APK build path proven
- OpenXR immersive mode working on Quest 3
- Head tracking working
- Seated static scene, no locomotion
- Procedural cabin geometry
- Procedural starfield
- Procedural engine hum, air circulation, and occasional panel beeps
- Lighting and room scale tuned through headset testing

The attempted first in-world control panel was removed from the publish baseline because it was visually messy and controller buttons were not mapped correctly. Controls are tracked in the roadmap.

## Requirements

- Unity 6000.5.2f1 or a compatible Unity 6 editor
- Android Build Support
- Android SDK and NDK Tools
- OpenJDK
- Meta Quest 3 or compatible Quest headset
- Developer Mode enabled on the headset
- USB debugging authorized

## Project Layout

- `Assets/Scripts/` - runtime C# scripts for starfield, ambience, and session logic
- `Assets/Editor/` - editor automation for scene setup and Android APK build
- `Assets/Scenes/Cabin_Seated_MVP.unity` - generated stable cabin scene
- `Assets/XR/` - Unity XR/OpenXR settings assets
- `Packages/` - Unity package manifest and lock file
- `ProjectSettings/` - Unity project settings
- `ROADMAP.md` - planned work

## Build

Open the project in Unity, then run:

`Starship Cabin -> Setup MVP Scene`

To build from the editor menu, use the included editor build tooling or call:

```bash
/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/6000.5.2f1/Unity.app/Contents/MacOS/Unity \
  -batchmode \
  -nographics \
  -quit \
  -projectPath "$PWD" \
  -executeMethod StarshipCabin.EditorTools.BuildStarshipCabin.BuildAndroidApk
```

The build output is:

`Builds/StarshipCabin-MVP.apk`

## Sideload

With the Quest connected and authorized:

```bash
adb install -r Builds/StarshipCabin-MVP.apk
adb shell monkey -p jp.openclaw.starshipcabin 1
```
